## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Create a `bot_config.py` file with the following structure:

```python
api_id = 123456
api_hash = "your_api_hash"
phone_number = "+98xxxxxxxxxx"  # Your phone number for the userbot session
bot_token = "your_bot_token"
admin_id = 123456789            # Numeric Telegram ID of the admin
channel_destination = "@your_channel_username"
```

2. Run the bot:

```bash
python main.py
```

You will be asked to log in once (for userbot session). After that, the bot will start listening for source channel messages and admin commands.

## 🧪 Admin Commands

Once the admin sends `/start`:

- Interactive keyboard with options appears
- Set source channel by sending its `@username`
- Adjust pricing margins (increase/decrease)
- Start manual pricing step-by-step
- Confirm message before sending to channel

All inputs are validated and stored in the database.

---

## 🔐 Security

- Only the defined `admin_id` has access to the bot controls
- The bot ignores messages from unauthorized users
- The source channel must match the configured username or ID

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The bot monitors a source Telegram channel for pricing messages.
- It parses values like **buy/sell price**, **USD**, **ounce**, and **global misqal**.
- Based on configured margins, it recalculates prices.
- The final message is formatted in a specific structure and sent to the destination channel.
